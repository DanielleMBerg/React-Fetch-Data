# React-Fetch-Data
I fetched data from an inspirational quote API that provided a motivatioanl quote every hour. I designed the app so that you have to click a button to read the quote. Music is set to autplay in the background.

#How to Run
To run on your own device, download all the files (except for the README file) and save them in one folder. Access the file in your terminal and run the files on your local server using http-server.

#Future Improvements
If this were to actually exist, I think it would be cool to have a countdown component to display when the next quote would be available. Also, to have a list that stores all of the quotes already retrieved.
